# PHP custom Microframework

PHP custom microframework build in The PHP Practictioner (Laracast) and for style Bootstrap all using Docker.  

# Tools used
- Docker and Docker compose
- Composer
- Bootstrap
- PHP 7
- MySQL
- Adminer

# Reason of using this tools
- First of all I used Docker because with Docker and Docker compose you only download the images required for the proyect and run docker-compose up to up all services you need. No install dependencies in your machine and easy to deploy.
- I used Composer to download Bootstrap and autoload all classes of the proyect. After that I just required the vendor/autoload in the index.php to call all the classes that need the proyect.
- I used PHP 7 because is the latest PHP stable version and I want all the features that this version provides.
- I used MySQL because is the RDBMS that I worked more and most popular in development business.
- I used Adminer for manage my database, I have to say that I never used before and I love it right now because is the more simple WEB admin for Databases.

# Why I made this.
I made this because I wanted to practice my skills of PHP and Docker but specially Docker and Docker compose. The code I given from a course in Laracasts call The PHP Practitioner. And I put style with Bootstrap to the views.  
With this course I learned foundamentals to understand more Laravel.
